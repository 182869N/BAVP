Description:

    (from 2014), SUTD (from 2015) and SUSS (from 2018) annually to survey the employment
    conditions of graduates about six months after their final examinations.  The
    Ministry of Education (MOE) publishes the results of key employment indicators
    of the survey to provide prospective students with timely and comparable data
    to assist them in making informed course decisions.  Graduates from NTU, NUS,
